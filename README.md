# Hi, I'm Hassan Khan 👋
**Computer Science student | Blockchain & Web3 researcher | C++, Python & JavaScript developer**

I build practical projects that solve real problems and learn by shipping — from desktop systems to web apps and Web3 experiments. I'm passionate about blockchain research and web development, and I enjoy combining both areas to explore decentralized applications and infrastructure.
